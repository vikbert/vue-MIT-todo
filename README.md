# M.I.T Todo App
Never feel overwhelmed at work again- the M.I.T. technique. A `Most Important Task (MIT)` is a 
critical task that will create the most significant results. 
Every day, create a list of `two or three M.I.T.s`, and focus on getting them done as soon as 
possible. Keep this list separate from your general to-do list.â€Š

For such purpose, I tried to rewrite a Todo App with Vue.js for personal use.
