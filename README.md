# M.I.T Todo App
[Demo App in Vue.js](https://mit-todo.netlify.com/)

This Todo Demo App is implemented with `Vue.js`.

I have also implemented two variants with `react.js` and `react+redux`:
- [Demo Todo in React.js](https://mit-todo-react.netlify.com/)
- [Demo Todo in react.js with Redux support](https://mit-todo-redux.netlify.com/)

## What is `MITs`
Never feel overwhelmed at work again- the M.I.T. technique. A `Most Important Task (MIT)` is a 
critical task that will create the most significant results. 
Every day, create a list of `two or three M.I.T.s`, and focus on getting them done as soon as 
possible. Keep this list separate from your general to-do list. Read more about [MITs](https://personalmba.com/most-important-tasks/).
